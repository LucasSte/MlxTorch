Items:

1. Make sure the minimal example works with the MLX backend.
2. Make sure there are no copies (Do I need this for the simple benchmark? I believe so. This way I can 
   guarantee I'm not spending time copying data).
3. Ensure the minimal example is faster than the MPS backend. Otherwise, there is no point in working on this project.

=> Implement functions as needed.
